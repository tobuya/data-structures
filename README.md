# Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to creating fundamental visual representations of various non-primitive data structures using Python. Each data structure will be visually depicted, accompanied by a link to a corresponding Medium article. These articles will provide an in-depth exploration of the major operations of each structure, supplemented with code snippets in Python and JavaScript.

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. There are two types of data structures:

- *Primitive data structures* - data structures that hold a single value (int, char, float, double, and pointer)
- *Non-primitive data structures* - data structures that can hold several values. It is divided into two:
  
    *1. Linear* - data is arranged in sequential manner, i.e, one element is connected to only one element in linear form (Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues).

    *2. Non-linear* - data is arranged in a random manner, i.e, one element is connected to 'n' number of elements (Trees and Graphs).


The major operations that we will perform on each data structure include:

- *Searching: We will search for any element in the data structure.*
  
- *Sorting: We will sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.*
  
- *Insertion: We will insert the new element in the data structure*
  
- *Updation: We will update the element, i.e., replace the element with another element.*

- *Deletion: We will perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.*

## 📘 Getting Started  <a name="getting-started"></a>

To run this project locally, you'll need to follow these steps.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### 📂 Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder.

```sh
cd my-desired-folder
git clone git@github.com:tobuya/data-structures.git
cd data-structures
```

Create a virtual environment using *venv* module available in Python 3.x (Recommended)

- Create a virtual environment
  
  ```sh
  python -m venv desired-name
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment
  
  *On Windows*
  ```sh
  desired-name\Scripts\activate
  ```

  *On Linux and macOS*
  ```sh
  source desired-name/bin/activate
  ```

### 📥 Installation

Install the required dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 💻 Generate Visualizations

To generate the visualizations, execute the following command:

```sh
python <data-structure-name>.py
```
